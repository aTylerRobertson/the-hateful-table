# The One Recipe

I'm a firm believer in meal planning, **however**, I am also a firm believer that whoever planned all this clearly wasn't hungry at the time. There needs to be a backup. Something that can be _fucking_ slapped together with no regard for taste but always solves the immediate problem, like giving a child money for their birthday. The One Recipe will vary from household to household but should always follow these rules:

1. Should never have more than five ingredients (seasoning is not an ingredient)
2. I should never have to buy more than 2 things fresh
3. Be flexible enough to change 1 ingredient without _fuck_ing up the whole thing

For me, right now, that looks like a curry bowl: Rice, instant katsu sauce, potatoes, carrots, chicken. I've just got to get the chicken and carrots, maybe the potatoes depending on how long it's been since the last shop, and I'm ready to roll.

Cook the rice in a pot (go to _fucking_ YouTube if you don't know how). Heat up a pan with oil and put the chicken in until cooked through (usually about 10 mins, but eyeball it or get a meat thermometer (don't you look at me like that, they're useful)). Remove the chicken, cook the potatoes and carrots with a bit more oil. Cut up the chicken and toss it back in with the veg. Salt, pepper, whatever seasoning you like. Prepare the sauce however the hell the box tells you to. Serve into a bowl.

Works every time.
