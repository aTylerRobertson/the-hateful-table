# The One Recipe

I'm a firm believer in meal planning, **however**, I am also a firm believer in sometimes being a lazy _bitch_ who doesn't want to make the thing that me-last-Monday thought would be easy. So there needs to be a backup. Something that can be _fucking_ slapped together with no regard for taste but always solves the immediate problem, like giving a child money for their birthday. The One Recipe will vary from household to household but should always follow these rules:

1. Should never have more than five ingredients (seasoning is not an ingredient)
2. I should never have to buy more than 2 things fresh
3. Be flexible enough to change 1 ingredient without _fuck_ing up the whole thing

For me, right now, that looks like a curry bowl:

- Rice
- Instant katsu sauce
- Potatoes
- Carrots
- Chicken

Cook the rice in a pot (go to _fucking_ YouTube if you don't know how). Heat up a pan with oil and put the chicken in until cooked through (usually about 10 mins, but eyeball it or get a meat thermometer (don't you look at me like that, they're useful)). Remove the chicken, cook the potatoes and carrots with a bit more oil. Cut up the chicken and toss it back in with the veg. Salt, pepper, whatever seasoning you like. Prepare the sauce however the hell the box tells you to. Serve into a bowl in this order:

1. Rice
2. Veg
3. Chicken
4. Sauce

Works every time.
