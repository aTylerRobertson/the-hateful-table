## Pasta

There's too many _fuck_ing kinds of pasta at the store. Buy the shape you like. Gluten-free if you have to.

Pot of water (tap water, don't get cute). On the stove, high heat. Boiling.

Drop in the pasta until adding more would be dangerous. 

Timer, 9 minutes. Wait until that goes off, then drain the water. No, I don't know who the _fuck_ "Al Dente" is. 

Stir in butter, salt, pepper. Could eat it like that. 

Add cheese if you like cheese. Add meat if you like meat. Save the leftovers, eat within three days. Throw anything older than that in the _fuck_ing bin.

Got plain, leftover pasta that's gone cold? That's the good _shit_. Chop up a couple fistfuls of fruit and veg that don't need cooking (cucumber, tomato, bell pepper), mix in with lemon juice, salt, pepper. Congrats idiot, you just made a pasta salad.

## Bread

Unless you're a _goddamn_ decent baker, pay someone else to make your _fuck_ing bread. Pay good money for bread, it's worth it. Something chewy with a thick crust, like a sourdough or rye.

Slice it as thick as your toaster will hold. If you don't have a toaster, slice it as thick as will fit in your mouth and put it over the nearest source of heat. Toast until crispy but not burnt. 

Add butter. Add meat if you like meat, jam if you like sweet. Broccoli (you _fuck_ing heard me) or tomatoes if you don't appreciate rhymes.
