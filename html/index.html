<h1>The Hateful Table</h1><br/>
 <br/>
Listen here, bucko. You're going to cook something today, whether you like it or not.<br/>
<h1>Pasta</h1><br/>
<br/>
There's too many <i>fuck</i>ing kinds of pasta at the store. Buy the shape you like. Gluten-free if you have to.<br/>
<br/>
Pot of water (tap water, don't get cute). On the stove, high heat. Boiling.<br/>
<br/>
Drop in the pasta until adding more would be dangerous. <br/>
<br/>
Timer, 9 minutes. Wait until that goes off, then drain the water. No, I don't know who the <i>fuck</i> "Al Dente" is. <br/>
<br/>
Stir in butter, salt, pepper. Could eat it like that. <br/>
<br/>
Add cheese if you like cheese. Add meat if you like meat. Save the leftovers, eat within three days. Throw anything older than that in the <i>fuck</i>ing bin.<br/>
