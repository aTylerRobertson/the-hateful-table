<p>Listen here, bucko: You're going to cook something today, whether you like it or not.</p>
<h1><a href="#Grocery Shopping">Grocery Shopping</a></h1>

<p>Grocery store chains are blighted pits that charge too much for not enough at a bad quality. If you can help it, only go there for three things:</p>

<p>1. Canned goods</p>

<p>2. Bulk items that last a while (pastas, basic spices, frozen pizzas, etc.)</p>

<p>3. <i>Shit</i> that isn't food</p>

<p>For everything else, you're going to harness the spite within yourself and make an alliance with the only people whose distain of Big Grocery matches your own: farmers, butchers, and corner store owners. </p>

<p>Food vendors are amongst the few people I can talk to comfortably, because we are unified in our purpose: to screw over the grocery store around the corner. No small talk, no introductions, just commerce. And when you find one, others will follow â€” ask your butcher where they get their fish from, for instance. As an added bonus, they can do a lot of your meal planning for you: ask for what's cheap and cook that until it's nearly burnt, or pay for what's fresh and caress it like a new lover.</p>
<h1><a href="#Carbs">Carbs</a></h1>

<h2><a href="#Pasta">Pasta</a></h2>

<p>There's too many <i>fuck</i>ing kinds of pasta at the store. Buy the shape you like. Gluten-free if you have to.</p>

<p>Pot of water (tap water, don't get cute). On the stove, high heat. Boiling.</p>

<p>Drop in the pasta until adding more would be dangerous. </p>

<p>Timer, 9 minutes. Wait until that goes off, then drain the water. No, I don't know who the <i>fuck</i> "Al Dente" is. </p>

<p>Stir in butter, salt, pepper. Could eat it like that. </p>

<p>Add cheese if you like cheese. Add meat if you like meat. Save the leftovers, eat within three days. Throw anything older than that in the <i>fuck</i>ing bin.</p>

<p>Got plain, leftover pasta that's gone cold? That's the good <i>shit</i>. Chop up a couple fistfuls of fruit and veg that don't need cooking (cucumber, tomato, bell pepper), mix in with lemon juice, salt, pepper. Congrats idiot, you just made a pasta salad.</p>

<h2><a href="#Bread">Bread</a></h2>

<p>Unless you're a decent baker, pay someone else to make your bread. Pay good money for it, too, it's worth it. Something chewy with a thick crust, like a sourdough or rye.</p>

<p>Slice it as thick as your toaster will hold. If you don't have a toaster, slice it as thick as will fit in your mouth and put it over the nearest source of heat. Toast until crispy but not burnt. </p>

<p>Add butter. Add meat if you like meat, jam if you like sweet. Broccoli (you <i>fuck</i>ing heard me) or tomatoes if you don't appreciate rhymes.</p>
