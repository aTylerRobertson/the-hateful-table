<h1>The Hateful Table</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Listen here, bucko. You're going to cook something today, whether you like it or not.</p>
<h1>Pasta</h1>

<p>There's too many <i>fuck</i>ing kinds of pasta at the store. Buy the shape you like. Gluten-free if you have to.</p>

<p>Pot of water (tap water, don't get cute). On the stove, high heat. Boiling.</p>

<p>Drop in the pasta until adding more would be dangerous. </p>

<p>Timer, 9 minutes. Wait until that goes off, then drain the water. No, I don't know who the <i>fuck</i> "Al Dente" is. </p>

<p>Stir in butter, salt, pepper. Could eat it like that. </p>

<p>Add cheese if you like cheese. Add meat if you like meat. Save the leftovers, eat within three days. Throw anything older than that in the <i>fuck</i>ing bin.</p>
