<h1><a href="#The Hateful Table">The Hateful Table</a></h1>

<p>Here's the deal: You're going to cook something today, whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>(This is a work in progress)</p>
<h1><a href="#Grocery Shopping">Grocery Shopping</a></h1>

<p>Grocery store chains are blighted pits that charge too much for not enough at a bad quality. If you can help it, only go there for three things:</p>

<p>1. Canned goods</p>

<p>2. Bulk items that last a while (pastas, basic spices, frozen pizzas, etc.)</p>

<p>3. <i>Shit</i> that isn't food</p>

<p>For everything else, you're going to harness the spite within yourself and make an alliance with the only people whose distain of Big Grocery matches your own: farmers, butchers, and corner store owners. </p>

<p>Food vendors are amongst the few people I can talk to comfortably, because we are unified in our purpose: to screw over the grocery store around the corner. No small talk, no introductions, just commerce. And when you find one, others will follow â€” ask your butcher where they get their fish from, for instance. As an added bonus, they can do a lot of your meal planning for you: ask for what's cheap and cook that until it's nearly burnt, or pay for what's fresh and caress it like a new lover.</p>
<h1><a href="#Carbs">Carbs</a></h1>

<h2><a href="#Pasta">Pasta</a></h2>

<p>There's too many <i>fuck</i>ing kinds of pasta at the store. Buy the shape you like. Gluten-free if you have to.</p>

<p>Pot of water (tap water, don't get cute). On the stove, high heat. Boiling.</p>

<p>Drop in the pasta until adding more would be dangerous. </p>

<p>Timer, 9 minutes. Wait until that goes off, then drain the water. No, I don't know who the <i>fuck</i> "Al Dente" is. </p>

<p>Stir in butter, salt, pepper. Could eat it like that. </p>

<p>Add cheese if you like cheese. Add meat if you like meat. Save the leftovers, eat within three days. Throw anything older than that in the <i>fuck</i>ing bin.</p>

<p>Got plain, leftover pasta that's gone cold? That's the good <i>shit</i>. Chop up a couple fistfuls of fruit and veg that don't need cooking (cucumber, tomato, bell pepper), mix in with lemon juice, salt, pepper. Congrats idiot, you just made a pasta salad.</p>

<h2><a href="#Bread">Bread</a></h2>

<p>Unless you're a decent baker, pay someone else to make your bread. Pay good money for it, too, it's worth it. Something chewy with a thick crust, like a sourdough or rye.</p>

<p>Slice it as thick as your toaster will hold. If you don't have a toaster, slice it as thick as will fit in your mouth and put it over the nearest source of heat. Toast until crispy but not burnt. </p>

<p>Add butter. Add meat if you like meat, jam if you like sweet. Broccoli (you <i>fuck</i>ing heard me) or tomatoes if you don't appreciate rhymes.</p>
<h1><a href="#The One Recipe">The One Recipe</a></h1>

<p>I'm a firm believer in meal planning, <b>however</b>, I am also a firm believer that whoever planned all this clearly wasn't hungry at the time. There needs to be a backup. Something that can be <i>fucking</i> slapped together with no regard for taste but always solves the immediate problem, like giving a child money for their birthday. The One Recipe will vary from household to household but should always follow these rules:</p>

<p>1. Should never have more than five ingredients (seasoning is not an ingredient)</p>
<p>2. I should never have to buy more than 2 things fresh</p>
<p>3. Be flexible enough to change 1 ingredient without <i>fuck</i>ing up the whole thing</p>

<p>For me, right now, that looks like a curry bowl:</p>

<p>- Rice</p>
<p>- Instant katsu sauce</p>
<p>- Potatoes</p>
<p>- Carrots</p>
<p>- Chicken</p>

<p>Cook the rice in a pot (go to <i>fucking</i> YouTube if you don't know how). Heat up a pan with oil and put the chicken in until cooked through (usually about 10 mins, but eyeball it or get a meat thermometer (don't you look at me like that, they're useful)). Remove the chicken, cook the potatoes and carrots with a bit more oil. Cut up the chicken and toss it back in with the veg. Salt, pepper, whatever seasoning you like. Prepare the sauce however the hell the box tells you to. Serve into a bowl in this order:</p>

<p>1. Rice</p>
<p>2. Veg</p>
<p>3. Chicken</p>
<p>4. Sauce</p>

<p>Works every time.</p>
