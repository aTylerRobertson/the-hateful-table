# Grocery Shopping

Grocery store chains are blighted pits that charge too much for not enough at a bad quality. If you can help it, only go there for three things:

1. Canned goods

2. Bulk items that last a while (pastas, basic spices, frozen pizzas, etc.)

3. _Shit_ that isn't food

For everything else, you're going to harness the spite within yourself and make an alliance with the only people whose distain of Big Grocery matches your own: farmers, butchers, and corner store owners. 

Food vendors are amongst the few people I can talk to comfortably, because we are unified in our purpose: to screw over the grocery store around the corner. No small talk, no introductions, just commerce. And when you find one, others will follow â€” ask your butcher where they get their fish from, for instance. As an added bonus, they can do a lot of your meal planning for you: ask for what's cheap and cook that until it's nearly burnt, or pay for what's fresh and caress it like a new lover.
