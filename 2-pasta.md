# Pasta

There's too many _fuck_ing kinds of pasta at the store. Buy the shape you like. Gluten-free if you have to.

Pot of water (tap water, don't get cute). On the stove, high heat. Boiling.

Drop in the pasta until adding more would be dangerous. 

Timer, 9 minutes. Drain. I don't know who the _fuck_ "Al Dente" is. 

Stir in butter, salt, pepper. Could eat it like that. 

Add cheese if you like cheese. Add meat if you like meat. Save the leftovers, eat within three days. Throw anything older than that in the _fuck_ing bin.
